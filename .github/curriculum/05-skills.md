# Ticket 5: Skills & Experience

**Task:** List your technical skills and any relevant experience or education.

### Instructions

1. Create a `skills.tsx` component.
2. Instead of a long list, try grouping your skills by category (e.g., "Frontend", "Backend", "Tools").
3. You can hardcode this data in the component or create another data file if you prefer.
4. Use a clean layout like a simple flexbox with wrapping tags or a structured list with icons.
5. If you have specific experience (internships, clubs, etc.), create an `experience.tsx` component to show a timeline or a simple list of roles and descriptions.
6. Add these components to `App.tsx`.
7. Make sure the fonts and colors match the Hero and Projects sections
8. Make sure to add `data-testid="skills-section"`

**Definition of Done:**
- Running `npx playright test skills.test.ts` in your project directory passes
