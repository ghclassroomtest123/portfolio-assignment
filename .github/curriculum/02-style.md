# Ticket 2: Plan Your Style

**Task:** Sketch out the visual direction for your site before touching code.

### Instructions

1. Before touching any code we should have a general idea of what we want our website to look like in terms of its colors, layout, and fonts
2. First, lets get started with our colors. Pick 2–3 colors: a base hue, a text-friendly shade, and an accent/container tone if you choose to add a third. Make sure the colors complement each other.
3. You can use [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and go to the generator to find colors fast
4. If you need some inspiration for the layout or fonts, you can look for some nice portfolios online or look at some of ours.
